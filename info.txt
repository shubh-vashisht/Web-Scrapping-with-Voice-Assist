CoronaVirus Web scrapping with Python and Voice Assistance

In this project, I have scrapped the website https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ to get
the details of all the coronavirus cases in all countries.
The code scrapes the data using parsehub, the accesses that data through the api, and then
processes that data to the user using Voice Assistance.

Voice Assistance is implemented using modules such as :
1. pyttsx3
2. speech_recognition

The code then listens to the user and converts that into text, simultaneously using that text
to get the requested data from the api data stored.
